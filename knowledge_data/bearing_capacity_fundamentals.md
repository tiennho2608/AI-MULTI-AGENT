# Bearing Capacity Analysis Fundamentals

Bearing capacity analysis determines the maximum load a foundation can support without experiencing excessive settlement or shear failure.

## Terzaghi Bearing Capacity Theory

The ultimate bearing capacity equation for shallow foundations on cohesionless soils:

**qu = γ×Df×Nq + 0.5×γ×B×Nγ**

Where:
- qu = Ultimate bearing capacity
- γ = Unit weight of soil
- Df = Depth of foundation
- B = Width/diameter of foundation
- Nq, Nγ = Bearing capacity factors (function of friction angle φ)

## Bearing Capacity Factors

The bearing capacity factors are theoretical values that depend on the soil's friction angle:

**For φ = 0°**: Nq = 1.0, Nγ = 0.0
**For φ = 30°**: Nq ≈ 18.4, Nγ ≈ 15.1
**For φ = 35°**: Nq ≈ 33.3, Nγ ≈ 31.2
**For φ = 40°**: Nq ≈ 64.2, Nγ ≈ 66.8

## Design Considerations

**Factor of Safety**: Typically 2.5-3.0 for ultimate bearing capacity
**Allowable Bearing Pressure**: qa = qu/FS
**Settlement Considerations**: Often governs design over bearing capacity failure

## Application in Practice

Modern foundation design considers both bearing capacity and settlement criteria. CPT data provides direct correlation to bearing capacity through qc values, while settlement analysis requires additional parameters like modulus relationships.
