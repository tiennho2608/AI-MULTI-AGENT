# Settle3 Software Help Guide

Settle3 is a comprehensive 3D settlement analysis software developed by Rocscience for geotechnical engineering applications.

## Main Features

**Multi-Layer Analysis**: Handles complex soil profiles with varying properties, allowing detailed modeling of heterogeneous ground conditions.

**Load Types**: Supports various loading conditions including point loads, distributed loads, embankments, and foundation systems.

**Settlement Methods**: Implements multiple calculation approaches including elastic theory, consolidation theory, and empirical methods.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Model Setup**: Define geometry, soil layers, and material properties
2. **Load Definition**: Apply surface loads, foundation loads, or construction sequences
3. **Analysis Parameters**: Set calculation methods and convergence criteria
4. **Results Interpretation**: Review settlement contours, time-settlement curves, and factor of safety

## Key Analysis Options

**Immediate Settlement**: Calculated using elastic theory with appropriate modulus values from laboratory tests or field correlations.

**Consolidation Settlement**: Time-dependent analysis using Terzaghi's theory or more advanced approaches for layered systems.

**Secondary Compression**: Long-term settlement prediction using secondary compression indices.

## Integration Capabilities

Settle3 integrates with other Rocscience products and accepts data from various field investigation methods including CPT, SPT, and laboratory testing programs. The software supports both 2D and 3D visualization of results.
